I have two seperate folders for the One Layer and Two Layer Networks.

This folder contains code for running the One layer network.

Run the script 'oneLayerNetwork.m' 

All the supporting functions are also provided in this folder.

The output will be four plots.

1) entropy loss plot vs epochs
2) classification error vs epochs 
3) accuracy vs epochs
4) first layer weights.
