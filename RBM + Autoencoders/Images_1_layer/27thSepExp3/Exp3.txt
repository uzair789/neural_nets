objective: to see if dropout gives a better weight visualization.

params used :

learning_rates = [0.5];%[0.3,0.5,0.7];
momentum = [0.9];
reg = [0];%,0.001,0.004];%
P = [0.5]; % p = 0 will shut drop out and p = 0.5 will turn it on
NUM_epochs = [500,1000];%500,1000]; 
hidden_layer_sizes = [100];%[200,300,500];


weights look very white ...not a good visual
