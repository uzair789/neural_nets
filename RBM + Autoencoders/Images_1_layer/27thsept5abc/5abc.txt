objective : to train the net  6 times with reasonable lr -- this exp solves 5 a,b c

params :

learning_rates = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5];%[0.3,0.5,0.7];
momentum = [0];
reg = [0];%,0.001,0.004];%
P = [0]; % p = 0 will shut drop out and p = 0.5 will turn it on
NUM_epochs = [500];%500,1000]; 
hidden_layer_sizes = [100];%[200,300,500];
